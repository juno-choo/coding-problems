Problem 7: Fibonacci Sequence

Write a function that takes an integer n and returns an array containing the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. Â  

The sequence begins: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,...

For example:

Input: n = 5

Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 8

Output: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13]

Input: n = 1

Output: [0]

Input: n = 2

Output: [0, 1]

Consider edge cases like n = 0 (should probably return an empty array []) and n = 1.
