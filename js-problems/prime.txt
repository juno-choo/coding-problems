Problem 8: Prime Number Check

Write a function that takes an integer num as input and returns true if the
number is prime, and false otherwise.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. Â  

For example:

Input: 2

Output: true

Input: 3

Output: true

Input: 4

Output: false (divisible by 2)

Input: 17

Output: true

Input: 1

Output: false (by definition, 1 is not prime)

Input: 0 or negative numbers

Output: false

Consider edge cases like 0, 1, 2, and negative numbers. How can you efficiently
 check for divisors?

 Prime numbers = 2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23
